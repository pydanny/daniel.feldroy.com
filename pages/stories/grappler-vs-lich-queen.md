I hit the mat for the last time, bowed to my coach, and walked toward the locker room.

The lights flickered then swallowed me. The world tilted, spun, and snapped away like a bad dream.

When I opened my eyes I was standing in a stone amphitheater lit by green witch-fire. A thousand armored spectators chanted in a language that tasted like rust. Across the sand, a woman in a crown of black ice watched me from a throne of petrified heroes. Her eyes were older than the arena; her smile was younger than my death.

A translucent pane of blue text popped in front of my face:

> WELCOME, OUTWORLDER
> CLASS: UNCLASSED
> WEAPON SKILL: NONE
> INVENTORY: EMPTY

Great. I’d been isekai’d without even a white-belt.

A gate clanged open and something the size of a horse, if horses wore plate mail and grew extra elbows, charged me swinging a flanged mace. Instinct snapped my hips low, but there was no gi to grip, only air scented with rot. The mace whistled past my temple. I rolled, shoulder-checked the thing’s knee, and felt the satisfying pop of ligament. It howled, toppled, and the crowd gasped as if I’d just turned water into blood.

I needed armor. All I saw were small buckler-sized shields dropped by dead fighters, round, iron, bossed like giant bottle caps. I snatched two, slid my forearms through the straps, and suddenly I had portable walls. The next orc-shaped contender swung a two-handed sword; I ducked behind the shields, charged like a ram, and double-leg’d him through the sand. Mount, S-mount, collar-tie with the rim of a shield, he was asleep in eight seconds.

Fight followed fight. I never drew blood; I just closed, clinched, choked. The shields were my lapels, my sleeves, my endless frames. Triangle from guard? I wedged a shield under a troll’s neck until the carotids clicked. Kimura? I threaded an arm between planks of oak and rotated until the shoulder whispered surrender. The scoreboard floating above the queen kept flashing:

> SUBMISSION AFTER SUBMISSION, NO KILL RECORDED

Between rounds I studied her. She tapped one finger against her throne when I inverted for a kneebar, the way a girl taps a library table when the story gets good. I realized she wasn’t bored; she was reading me.

On the seventh night the arena emptied except for us. She descended the steps, robes trailing frost.

“You refuse the blade,” she said. Her voice smelled of winter apples.

“I’m a grappler,” I answered. “Blades end stories. I just change the ending to ‘nap time.’ ”

“And if I decree you must kill?”

“Then I’ll keep refusing until you run out of necks to break.”

She laughed, sound of icicles falling in spring. “Do you know who I am?”

“Local dungeon final boss, eternal ruler, yada yada. You’re also lonely.”

The smile froze, cracked, re-formed softer. “Explain.”

“You’ve watched ten thousand sword-nerds hack each other for centuries. I’m the first guy who’d rather hug. You’re curious, and curiosity is the only thing time hasn’t rotted in you.”

She circled me, fingers brushing the dented shields. “Your bones would make exquisite sentinels.”

“Sure, but then you’d lose the only puzzle that doesn’t bleed out in five minutes. Let me live, and I’ll stay interesting. Kill me, and tomorrow some paladin shows up with a holy sword and a prophecy. You’ve seen that episode.”

She stopped behind me. I felt her breath, cold enough to crystallize sweat, on the back of my neck. “Swear you will never raise arms against me.”

I turned, shields lowered. “I swear on my belt that never existed. If I ever attack you, may my guard forever be passed.”

She tilted her head. “That means something to you?”

“Worse than death.”

The queen extended a hand. A silver ring shaped like an ouroboros lay across her palm. “Wear this. It will return you to your world at the moment you left. But the moment you speak of me with fear or malice, you’ll be pulled back, permanently, as my champion, and you will kill.”

I slid the ring onto a finger already swollen from gripping shields. “Deal. But I get visiting rights. Someday I’ll teach you to shrimp escape.”

“Perhaps,” she said, “I will teach you to freeze time.”

The amphitheaster blurred into fluorescent lights and the smell of disinfectant. My coach was still clapping me on the back for the tournament win I never finished. The ring tightened once, like a reminder, then went cold and inert.

I teach classes now, kids, cops, dreamers. Whenever I bow onto the mat I feel the echo of two shields on my forearms, and I remember that somewhere a lich queen is watching, curious, waiting for the day I’m interesting enough to summon back.

And I smile, because for the first time in my life I’m not afraid of being submitted by eternity.
