## Recap of 2024

- We lived in London, UK and Manila, Philippines
- Spent another year with my soul mate, Audrey. This year we spent much of it in one of her homelands, the Philippines. 
- Uma
- Suffered a serious back injury (herniated disc) from some bad lifts that had me bedridden for the first two months of the year. While I'm recovered from the injury I am still struggling at times with intense sciatica. What's been effective for my recovery has been acupuncture, anti-inflammatories, stretching, mobility exercises, and living in a warm country. I still do BJJ, but am careful about partners and restrict my sparring to just 2-3 rolls per session.
- Started doing a lot more gi BJJ
- Spent much of the year in the Philippines. I appreciate the people - individuals in general are friendly, realistic, hard-working, and trustworthy. The nation has come a long way in the 14 years I've been visiting. 
- Left an AI lab and have been focusing on startups and having fun with FOSS. 
- Started a web framework called 'Air' with Audrey
- Rewrote this blog in Air
- Travelled to new places:
    - ✈️ Davao, PH
    - ✈️ Denver, CO
    - ✈️ Melbourne, AU
    - ✈️ Tokyo, JP
    - 🚄 Yokohama, JP
