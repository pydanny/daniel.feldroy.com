title: "Concussion (I Hit My Head)"
---

On January 16th, 2026 I suffered a head injury that turned out to be a significant concussion. I wasn't doing anything exciting or dangerous, I just bent down to tie my shoelace and stood up fast. I hit the back of my head on something hard. At the time I thought I was fine.

Thirty hours later I was showing signs of a [concussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concussion). I've had these before so I expected it to go away in a week or two. However, while I've improved this one isn't going away.

I've been to a neurologist and an alternative medicine specialist. I've had an MRI so we know its not a stroke. I've been avoiding any kind of stress. I went from frequent intense workouts to a much less vigorous routine. I'm doing my best to eat healthy and stay hydrated. I'm hopeful that I'll make a full recovery, but it's been a slow process so far.

I've had to curtail nearly all my normal activities. I haven't been able to do any of my hobbies, and I've had to take a break from work. Traffic and crowds tire me out quickly and trigger other symptoms, so travel is limited. It's been frustrating, but I'm trying to stay positive and focus on my recovery. I contribute with housework and close errands.

I can code or read code for a little bit each day, but I have to be careful not to overdo it. You might see me do tiny changes on inconsequential projects so I can keep my hand in things. Interestingly enough, working with LLMs doesn't insulate me from symptoms. 

I've discovered writing fiction doesn't trigger symptoms quickly. So I've returned to that hobby. 

Audrey has been amazing throughout this process. She's been taking care of me and our daughter Uma. Our daughter has also been very helpful.
