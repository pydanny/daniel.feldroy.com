It's been just over a month since I got injured. These days I usually wake up clear headed and with no symptoms. I can go about my day and do activities, but I must avoid triggers. Unfortunately the triggers ruin me until I get several hours of rest.

## Triggers

Slow triggers taking hours to cause symptoms:

- Crowds
- Looking at moving traffic
- Being in a car

Medium triggers that take effect in 10-30 minutes:

- Deep thought like when writing code or working with LLMs (I think hard about prompts and validation)
- Stress or excitement
- Outlining of stories

Fast triggers that take effect in seconds:

- Context switching when in deep thought
- Large blocks of geometric shapes like:
  - Those found in tall modern buildings
  - Graph paper
  - Hexagonal patterns
- Very fine print on paper
- Keeping my eyes on a point and moving my head around quickly (vestibulo-ocular reflex mismatch)
- Learning new board games (I can play games I already know, but learning new ones is a problem)

## Symptoms

- Brain fog
- Fatigue
- Headache (usually in the front right of my head)
- Dizziness (but no loss of balance)
- Straight lines become very prominent and distracting
- Memory loss (I'm aware that I am having trouble tracking dates, and my wife and daughter both say I'm more forgetful than usual)

## Updates

- Feb 23, 2026: Added graph paper and hexagonal patterns to the list of fast triggers
- Feb 27, 2026: Added outlining of fiction to medium triggers
