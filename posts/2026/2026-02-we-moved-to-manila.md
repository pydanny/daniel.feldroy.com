title: We moved to Manila!
---

Last year we relocated to [Metro Manila](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila), [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines) for the foreseeable future. [Audrey](https://audrey.feldroy.com/)'s mother is from here, and we wanted our daughter Uma to have the opportunity to spend time with her extended family and experience another line of her heritage.

## Where are you living?

In [Makati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makati), a city that contains one of the major business districts in Metro Manila. Specifically we're in Salcedo village, a neighboorhood in the [CBD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makati_Central_Business_District), made of towering residential and business buildings with numerous shops, markets, and a few parks. This area allows for a walkable life, which is important to us coming from London.

## What about the USA?

The USA is our homeland and we're US citizens. We still have family and friends there. We're hoping to visit the US at least once a year.

## What about the UK?

We loved living in London, and have many good friends there. I really enjoyed working for [Kraken Tech](https://kraken.tech/), but my time came to an end there so our visas were no longer valid. We hope to visit the UK (and the rest of Europe) as tourists, but without the family connection it's harder to justify than trips to the homeland.

## What about your daughter?

Uma loves Manila and is in second grade at an international school (CIE Makati) here in walking distance of our residence. We had looked into getting her into a local public school with a notable science program, but the paperwork required too much lead time. We do like the small class sizes at her current school, and how they accomodate the different learning speeds of students. She will probably stay there for a while.

For extra curricular activities she's enjoying Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, climbing, yoga, and swimming.

## If I'm in Manila can I meet up with you?

Sure! Some options:

- We're long-time members of the [Python Philippines](https://python.ph/) community, so you can often find us at their events
- If you train in BJJ, I'm usually at [Open Mat Makati](https://www.openmatmakati.com/) quite a bit. Just let me know ahead of time so I can plan around it
- If you want to meet up for coffee, hit me up on social media. Manila is awesome for coffee shops!
