description: There's this way of writing on LinkedIn where you start with a personal story, and then you draw a business lesson from it. It's a silly pattern that often reeks of faked success and other forms of falsehood. So what better use of my available writing time before symptoms kick in than to write one of those posts?

title: What my head injury taught me about B2B sales
---

Last month I had a [head injury](https://daniel.feldroy.com/tags/concussion) that has almost completely sidelined me from work.

- No laptop
- No calls
- No pull request reviews
- Workouts when from highly intense daily BJJ & heavy weight sessions to walks, tai chi, and light weights
- No direct messages except a few with close family and friends

Just silence and recovery and boredom. 

Fortunately for me we try to live an affordable lifestyle and have built a reserve for emergencies. I'm able to take the time I need to heal. This is a far cry from the periods of desperation in my youth when I lived paycheck to paycheck. I remember having to work through being extremely sick or injured because the bills were due.

The insights I gained from this experience are:

1. Health is your greatest asset and it can be stripped from you in an instant
2. The world doesn't stop when you can't work, bills are still due
3. Most people you know will send you their best wishes and support
4. A few people may try to advantage of your vulnerability and try to get something from you
5. Be married to someone awesome like [my wife](https://audrey.feldroy.com/), who has been an absolute rock through this whole ordeal
